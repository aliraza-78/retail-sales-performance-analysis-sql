# Retail Sales Performance Analysis using SQL

## Project Overview
This project analyzes retail sales data using SQL to uncover insights related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability.

The goal of this project is to simulate real-world business questions that a data analyst would solve using SQL.

## Database Schema
The database is designed using a normalized retail structure and consists of the following tables:
- Customers
- Orders
- Order_Items
- Products

Each table is connected using primary and foreign keys to support accurate analysis.

## Key Business Questions

### Easy
- How many total customers and orders are there?
- What is the total sales revenue and total profit?
- What is total sales by product category?

### Moderate
- Who are the top customers and products by total sales?
- What is the monthly sales trend?
- What is the Average Order Value (AOV)?
- Which cities generate the highest total sales?

### Advanced
- Which customers have stopped purchasing (inactive customers)?
- Which months have sales below the overall monthly average?
- Which products have profit margins below the average?
- How do products rank within each category by sales?
- Which orders have total sales above the average order value?

## Tools Used
- MySQL
- MySQL Workbench
- GitHub
