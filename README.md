Retail Sales Performance Analysis using SQL
Project Overview

This project analyzes retail sales data using SQL to answer real-world business questions related to sales performance, customer behavior, and product profitability.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical SQL skills that a data analyst would use in a real business environment, including data modeling, querying, and deriving insights.

Database Schema

The database follows a normalized retail structure consisting of four main tables:

Customers – customer details and demographics

Orders – order-level information

Order_Items – product-level sales details per order

Products – product and category information
